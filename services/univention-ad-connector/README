Check list for DEV and QA:
==========================
* scripts/prepare-new-instance must work (Regression Bug #50713)
* Instances created with scripts/prepare-new-instance before the
  update must continue to work (see also Bug #51918)

Caveats:
========
* object['attributes'] may contain a mix of OL and AD attributes.
  This can be nasty for attributes like "mail", which exist
  in both object types.

* Warning: mapping of mail related attributes is especially nasty:
** git log --grep "Bug #51647: fix regression of Bug #18501"
** git log --grep "Bug #18501: Fix handling of proxyAddresses mapping"
** git log --grep "Bug #43216: Revised mapping for MS-Exchange related 'proxyAddresses'"

Improvement Suggestions:
========================
* Rename "object" and seprate object["attributes"] into "ldap_obj_ol" and "ldap_obj_ad"
  and pass them around to all functions (e.g. ucs_create_functions),
  so they have all required info, can pick the correct attribute values (OL vs AD) in searches
  and don't need to search stuff over and over again.
* Maybe replace "object" by a "obj_replication_state", which holds "ldap_obj_ol" and "ldap_obj_ad"
* Differenciate between "ldap_obj_ol_from_listener" and "ldap_obj_ol_current"
