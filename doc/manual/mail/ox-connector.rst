OX Connector
============

:program:`OX Connector` is an app in Univention App Center. It synchronizes selected users
and groups to a remote OX App Suite installation like for example a hosted OX
App Suite. The app should not be used with the separate OX App Suite app from
the App Center, because it has synchronization already included.
