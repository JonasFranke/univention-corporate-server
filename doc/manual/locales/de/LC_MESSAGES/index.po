"Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a Linux-based server operating "
"system for the operation and administration of IT infrastructures for "
"companies and authorities. UCS implements an integrated, holistic concept"
" with consistent, central administration and can ensure the operation of "
"all the components in an interrelated security and trust context, the so-"
"called UCS domain. At the same time, UCS supports a wide range of open "
"standards and includes extensive interfaces to infrastructure components "
"and management tools from other manufacturers, meaning it can be "
"integrated in existing environments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:22
msgid ""
"UCS consists of reliable open source software tried and tested in "
"organizations of different sizes. These software components are "
"integrated together via the |UCSUMS|. This allows the integration and "
"administration of the system in both simple and complex distributed or "
"virtualized environments."

"The *base system* encompasses the operating system of the UCS Linux "
"distribution maintained by Univention and based on Debian GNU/Linux. It "
"largely includes the same software selection as Debian GNU/Linux as well "
"as additional tools for the installation, updating and configuration of "
"clients and servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:70
msgid ""
"The |UCSUMS| realizes a single point of administration where the accounts"
" of all domain members (users, groups, and hosts) and services such as "
"DNS and DHCP are managed in a single directory service. Core components "
"of the management system are the services OpenLDAP (directory service), "
"Samba (provision of domain, file and print services for Windows), "
"Kerberos (authentication and single sign on), DNS (network name "
"resolution) and SSL/TLS (secure transmission of data between systems). It"
" can be used either via a web interface (|UCSUMC| modules) or in the "
"command line and in individual scripts. The UCS management system can be "
"extended with APIs (application programming interfaces) and provides a "
"flexible client-server architecture which allows changes to be "
"transferred to the involved systems and be activated there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:84
msgid ""
"Additional components from Univention and other manufacturers can be "
"installed using the App Center. They expand the system with numerous "
"functions such as groupware, document management and services for "
"Windows, meaning that they can also be run from a UCS system and "
"administrated via the UCS management system."

"Linux is an operating system which always had a focus on stability, "
"security and compatibility with other operating systems. Therefore Linux "
"is predestined for being used in server operating systems that are "
"stable, secure and highly available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:100
msgid ""
"Built on that base, UCS is a server operating system which is optimized "
"for the simple and secure operation and management of applications and "
"infrastructure services in enterprises and public authorities. For "
"efficient and secure management such applications rely on the tight "
"integration in the user and permission management of the |UCSUMS|."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:106
msgid ""
"UCS can be employed as the basis for the IT infrastructure in companies "
"and authorities and provide the central control for it. This makes a "
"considerable contribution to secure, efficient and cost-effective IT "
"operation. The business-critical applications are integrated in a uniform"
" concept, adapted to each other and pre-configured for professional "
"utilization. Alternatively it can be operated as part of an existing "
"Microsoft Active Directory domain."

#: ../../index.rst:126
msgid "Domain concept"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:128
msgid ""
"In an IT infrastructure managed with UCS, all servers, clients and users "
"are contained in a common security and trust context, referred to as the "
"UCS domain. Every UCS system is assigned a so-called server role during "
"the installation. Possible system roles are Directory Node, "
"|UCSMANAGEDNODE| and client."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:139
msgid "UCS domain concept"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:141
msgid ""
"Depending on the system role within the domain, such services as "
"Kerberos, OpenLDAP, Samba, modules for domain replication or a Root CA "
"(certification authority) are installed on the computer. These are "
"automatically configured for the selected system role. The manual "
"implementation and configuration of every single service and application "
"is therefore not required. Due to the modular design and extensive "
"configuration interfaces, tailor-made solutions to individual "
"requirements can nevertheless be realized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:150
msgid ""
"The integration of Samba, which provides the domain service for clients "
"and servers operated with Microsoft Windows, makes Univention Corporate "
"Server compatible with Microsoft Active Directory (AD), whereby the "
"system acts as an Active Directory server for Windows-based systems. "
"Consequently, for example, group policies for Microsoft Windows systems "
"can be administrated in the usual way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:157
msgid ""
"UCS can also be operated as part of an existing Microsoft Active "
"Directory domain. This way, users and groups of the Active Directory "
"domain can access applications from the Univention App Center."

"The Univention App Center offers additional UCS components and extensions"
" and a broad selection of business IT software, e.g., groupware and "
"collaboration, file exchange, CRM or backup. These applications can be "
"installed in existing environments with a few clicks and are usually "
"ready to use. In most cases they are directly integrated into the "
"|UCSUMS| such that they are available as |UCSUMC| modules. This provides "
"a central management of data on the domain level and obsoletes the "
"separate management of, e.g., user data in multiple places."
msgstr ""

msgid "LDAP directory service"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:183
msgid ""
"With the |UCSUMS|, all the components of the UCS domain can be centrally "
"administrated across computer, operating system and site boundaries. It "
"thus provides a single point of administration for the domain. One "
"primary element of the UCS management system is an LDAP directory in "
"which the data required across the domain for the administration are "
"stored. In addition to the user accounts and similar elements, the data "
"basis of services such as DHCP is also saved there. The central data "
"management in the LDAP directory avoids not only the repeated entry of "
"the same data, but also reduces the probability of errors and "
"inconsistencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:194
msgid ""
"An LDAP directory has a tree-like structure, the root of which forms the "
"so-called basis of the UCS domain. The UCS domain forms the common "
"security and trust context for its members. An account in the LDAP "
"directory establishes the membership in the UCS domain for users. "
"Computers receive a computer account when they join the domain. Microsoft"
" Windows systems can also join the domain such that users can sign in "
"there with their domain passport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:202
msgid ""
"UCS utilizes OpenLDAP as a directory service server. The directory is "
"provided by the |UCSPRIMARYDN| and replicated on all UCS Directory Nodes "
"in the domain. The complete LDAP directory is also replicated on a "
"|UCSBACKUPDN| as this can replace the |UCSPRIMARYDN| in an emergency. In "
"contrast, the replication on |UCSREPLICADN| can be restricted to certain "
"areas of the LDAP directory using ACLs (access control lists) in order to"
" realize a selective replication. For example, this may be desirable if "
"data should only be stored on as few servers as possible for security "
"reasons. For secure communication of all systems within the domain, UCS "
"integrates a root CA (certification authority)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:262
msgid ""
"The tree-like structure of LDAP directories is similar to that of a file "

"one container which itself can be adopted by other containers. The root "
"container is also called the LDAP base object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:267
msgid ""
"Policies describe certain administrative settings which are applied to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:272
msgid ""
"For example, users can be organized in different containers or "
"organizational units (which are a form of containers) depending on which "
"department they belong to. Settings such as the desktop background or "
"accessible programs can then be connected to these organizational units "
"using policies. Subsequently, they apply for all users within the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:286
msgid ""
"The listener/notifier mechanism is an important technical component of "
"the |UCSUMS|. With this, the creation, editing or deleting of entries in "
"the LDAP directory triggers defined actions on the computers in question."
" For example, the creation of a directory share with the UMC module "
":guilabel:`Shares` leads to the share firstly being entered in the LDAP "
"directory. The listener/notifier mechanism then ensures that the NFS and "
"Samba configuration files are also expanded accordingly on the selected "
"server and that the directory is created in the file system of the "
"selected server if it does not already exist."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:296
