"Authentication is performed via Kerberos. Users logged in on a Windows "
"client which is a member of a Samba/AD domain authenticate themselves on "
"the proxy with the ticket that they received when they logged in to the "
"domain. The :program:`univention-squid-kerberos` package must be "
"installed on every proxy server for it to be possible to enable Kerberos "
"authentication. Then the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`squid/krb5auth` must be set "
"to ``yes`` and Squid restarted."

"If NTLM is used an NTLM authentication is performed for every HTTP query "
"as standard. If for example the website ``https://www.univention.com/`` "
"is opened, the subsequent pages and images are loaded in addition to the "
"actual HTML page. The NTLM authentication can be cached per domain: If "
"the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`squid/ntlmauth/keepalive` is set to ``yes``, no "
"further NTLM authentication is performed for subsequent HTML queries in "
"the same domain. In case of problems with local user accounts it may help"
" to set this variable to ``no``."
