"The Univention App Center allows simple integration of software "

"The Univention App Center can be opened via the UMC module :guilabel:`App"

"filtered using the :guilabel:`Category` panel. More filters like the "
":emphasis:`Badges` and the :emphasis:`App License` can be used. For "
"example, the view can be limited to applications with the categories "
"``Education`` or ``Office``. To only show the ``Recommended Apps`` for "
