desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The script `resync_object_from_ucs.py` has an option `--first`
   which allows a particular DN or filtered list of DNs to be replicated
   with priority. This update fixes the sort order to actually
   put the DNs to the first position in the synchronization queue.
