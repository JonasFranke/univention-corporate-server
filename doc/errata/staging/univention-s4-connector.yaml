desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The script `resync_object_from_ucs.py` has an option `--first`
   which allows a particular DN or filtered list of DNs to be replicated
   with priority. This update fixes the sort order to actually
   put the DNs to the first position in the synchronization queue.
 * If the system was upgraded from UCS 4.4 and had rejected objects
   the internal SQLite database was corrupted. The database will be repaired.
