desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The package univention-self-service has been migrated to Python 3.
   The UMC module will still be executed via Python 2 until UCS 5.0-2
   due to possible custom plugins for sending the password recovery tokens.
   Customers need to provide their custom plugins for Python 3 until then.
