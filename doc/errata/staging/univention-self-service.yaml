 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The error message shown during password reset or when creating a
   new account now appends the text from the UCR variable
   `umc/login/password-complexity-message/.*` when password complexity
   criteria are not matched.
  * Self-service user attributes specified in `self-service/udm_attributes`
    can be configured as read-only via the UCR variable
    `self-service/udm_attributes/read-only`.
