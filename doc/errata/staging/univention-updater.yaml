 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The description of the repository/online/* UCR variables which is displayed
   by using the ucr info command was updated to document which variables are
   defined as deprecated and should no longer be used.
 * The types of the repository/online/* and repository/online/component/*
   ending with 'server' or 'port' have been updated to ucr type 'url_http'
   and respectively 'portnumer' in order to allow a better type checking.
