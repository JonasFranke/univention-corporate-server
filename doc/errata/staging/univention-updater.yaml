 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Due to the updated repository structure, creating a local repository
   mirror from a UCS 5 DVD has been deprecated. A new local repository will
   now directly be mirrored from the upstream online repository.
 * A light theme for UCS web interfaces has been implemented.
