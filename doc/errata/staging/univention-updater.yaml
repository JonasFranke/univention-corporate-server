 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Updating a local repository server failed when additional components hosted
   on a separate server like `service.software-univention.de` were enabled:
   Calling `univention-repository-update net` failed with a
   `ConfigurationError` pointing to a wrong URL on
   `updates.software-univention.de` instead.
