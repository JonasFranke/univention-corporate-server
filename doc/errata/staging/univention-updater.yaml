desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Fix the link to the release notes of future UCS releases.
  * With UCS 5.0-3 the updater did ignore the url path when
    creating the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/20_ucs-online-component.list
    file leading to issues updating the component.
    This was fixed with this update.
