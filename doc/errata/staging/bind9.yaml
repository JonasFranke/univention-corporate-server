 * Non-maintainer upload by the Debian LTS Team.
 * CVE-2023-2828: It was discovered that the effectiveness of the
   cache-cleaning algorithm used in named(5) can be severely diminished by
   querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively
   allowing the configured max-cache-size limit to be significantly exceeded.
 * Add debian/.gitlab-ci.yml
 * Allow blhc failures; "CPPFLAGS missing", etc.
 * Backport a1dbd6d68 and ef4eef07f4 from bind9.git to make autopkgtests pass.
