 This update addresses the following issue:
 * After adding or removing printers UCS tells Samba to reload the
   configuration. In Samba 4.16 there is a new service `samba-bgqd`, which
   required adjusting the way that the `cups-printers.py` listener initiates
   the reload to make Samba recognize the changes immediately.
