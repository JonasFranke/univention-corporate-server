desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The ownership, group and permissions of LDAP backups are now configurable
   via the UCR variables `slapd/backup/owner`, `slapd/backup/group"`and
   `slapd/backup/permissions`.
 * The UCR variable description for the variable `ldap/database/type` has been
   updated and now describes deprecated and recommended values.
 * Create initial fake schema in unjoined Backup/Replica servers
   too to avoid invalid slapd configurations that may break upgrades.
