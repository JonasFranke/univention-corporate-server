fix: 10.0.2-3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * This extension allows a group of people to reset the passwords of other
   users. Privileged users can be exempted, e.g. `Domain Admins`. The set of
   these users is stored in UCR variables
   `ldap/acl/user/passwordreset/internal/groupmemberlist/`, but the ordering
   was not stable and could change on each invocation of
   `ldap-group-to-file.py`. This lead to a restart of `slapd`, which
   interrupted access to LDAP on a regular basis. This has been fixed by
   sorting the users and restarting `slapd` only when the set of users
   changes.
