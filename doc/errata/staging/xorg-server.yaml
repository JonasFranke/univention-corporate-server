desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-6816: A flaw was found in `X.Org` server. Both
   `DeviceFocusEvent` and the `XIQueryPointer` reply contain a bit for each
   logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any
   value up to `255`, but the `X.Org` Server was only allocating space for
   the device's particular number of buttons, leading to a heap overflow if a
   bigger value was used.
 * CVE-2024-0229: Reattaching to different master device may lead to
   `out-of-bounds` memory access.
 * CVE-2024-21885: Heap buffer overflow in `XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent`.
 * CVE-2024-21886: Heap buffer overflow in `DisableDevice`.
