fix: 1.0.2-4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The "check_univention_joinstatus" called "ldapsearch" with the machine
   credentials, which then were visible in the process list.
 * The metrics are now written with a timestamp so that information are more
    accurate. They are now written using the official
    `python3-prometheus-client` library.
