 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The join of UCS@School replica servers into environments with many objects
   often failed due to timeouts in the joinscripts
   97univention-s4-connector,98univention-samba4-dn
   and 98univention-squid-samba4, because the synchronisation of
   the newly replicated objects to Samba4 blocked the synchronisation of
   objects which are created during the join and necessary for
   its completion. The joinscripts have been
   modified to sync these vital objects first, which speeds up
   the join process considerably.
