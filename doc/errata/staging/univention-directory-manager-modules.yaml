desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Users/ldap objects could not be created if the mspolicy
   password complexity criteria was configured due to the
   missing displayname. This has been fixed.
 * UDM now enforces uniqueness of the name of objects in the same subtree
   position.
 * The descriptions of email related attributes have been improved.
 * ucs_registerLDAPExtension from the Univention shell function library
   now allows the option umcmessagecatalog. This option can be used to
   supply translation files in GNU message catalog format for the UMC.
 * Since the Python 3 migration broken LDAP filter where generated which
   contained bytestring-representations for UDM property names which are
   used in filters. The values are now correctly decoded.
 * The uniqueness of groupnames is now also checked when renaming a group.
 * The users/user lockedTime is now correctly handled in Python 3.
