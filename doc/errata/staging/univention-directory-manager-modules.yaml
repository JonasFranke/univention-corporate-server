desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Changing the case of the name or email attributes will no longer be
   prevented by the locking mechanism.
 * A crash while accessing an user with multiple user certificates has been
   repaired.
 * The logic for mapping UDM syntax classes to UMC frontend widgets and to get
   the dynamic choices for a UDM syntax have been moved into the UDM syntax
   classes.
 * Syntax classes can now depend on another UDM property and restrict their
   choices based on that.
 * The available mail domains are now suggested when entering values for the
   attribute `mailPrimaryAddress` of objects `users/user`.
 * The error message for invalid dates has been improved by specifying the
   valid range.
 * Clarified error message for invalid host name or FQDN.
 * The error handling of the syntax class `jpegPhoto` was broken since UCS
   5.0-0 and has been repaired.
