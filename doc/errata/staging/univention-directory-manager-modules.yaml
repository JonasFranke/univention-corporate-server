desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * It is now possible to create extended attributes for LDAP operational
   attributes.
 * The `primaryGroup` of `users/user` was unexpectedly reset to the default
   primary group when the primary group could not be read in LDAP. This was
   the case when the LDAP replication was not yet done or when the user had
   no permission to read it. The behaior is now postponed to actual
   modifications of the object.
 * The Python backend code to evaluate and apply template defaults has been
   removed.
