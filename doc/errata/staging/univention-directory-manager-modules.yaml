fix: 15.0.25-4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The `uldap` library now supports the SASL binding mechanism `OAUTHBEARER`.
 * On UCS 5.2 systems purely numeric user and group names are no longer
   allowed by default. The UCR variables
   `directory/manager/user/enable-legacy-username-format` and
   `directory/manager/group/enable-legacy-cn-format` have been added to
   optionally allow such names if needed. System upgrades detect whether fully
   numeric names are already in use, in which case they are automatically
   allowed.
