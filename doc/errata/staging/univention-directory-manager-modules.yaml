desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When computer objects were assigned with a network the DHCP and DNS
   settings weren't saved if a custom IP was specified. This has been
   corrected.
 * Values for the "complex" syntax class can now contain double quotes.
 * User objects now provide two additional properties: `placeOfBirth` and
   `gender`.
 * It is possible again to detect, search and modify users/ldap objects which
   have univentionObjectFlag=functional.
