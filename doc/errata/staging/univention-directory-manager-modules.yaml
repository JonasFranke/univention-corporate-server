desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A regression introduced by Bug 54883 has been fixed which caused that
   objects `user/ldap` could not be fetched via the UDM REST API.
 * The property `pwdChangeNextLogin` of `users/user` objects was not correctly
   unmapped in case it was not set. This caused the UDM REST API to wrongly
   represent it as `None` instead of `False`.
bug: [55189, 55226]
