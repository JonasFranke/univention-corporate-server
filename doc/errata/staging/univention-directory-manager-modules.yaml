fix: 15.0.13-5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The global uniqueness of `mailAlternativeAdress` with `mailPrimaryAddress`
   is now configurable via the UCR variable
   `directory/manager/mail-address/uniqueness`.
 * The performance and debuggability of the UDM command line client has been
   improved.
 * The UDM command line client now writes error messages and warnings to
   stdandard error.
 * A regression in UCS 5.0 for LDAP presence filters (`attribute=*`) has been
   fixed. UDM modules which rewrite filters can now reliably test for LDAP
   presence filters.
 * The attribute pwhistory can store and interpret NT hashes.
