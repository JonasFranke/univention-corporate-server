desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When setting a user as a member of a group in UDM, that had the
   same uid but a different DN of another member, the related
   memberUid attribute of the group got dropped. This happened in the
   cool Solution user-group-sync during move operations. This
   behaviour has been fixed.
