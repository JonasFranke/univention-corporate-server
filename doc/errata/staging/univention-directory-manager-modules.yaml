fix: 15.0.13-6A~5.0.0.202209052006
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The global uniqueness of `mailAlternativeAdress` with `mailPrimaryAddress`
   is now configurable via the UCR variable
   `directory/manager/mail-address/uniqueness`.
 * The performance and debuggability of the UDM command line client has been
   improved.
 * The UDM command line client now writes error messages and warnings to
   standard error.
 * A regression in UCS 5.0 for LDAP presence filters (`attribute=*`) has been
   fixed. UDM modules which rewrite filters can now reliably test for LDAP
   presence filters.
 * UDM now can store NT hashes in the attribute `pwhistory`. Until now it
   used the attribute `sambaPasswordHistory`, which only stores salted
   hashes of hashes, which doesn't allow synchronization to Samba/AD.
   UDM now doesn't care about the attribute `sambaPasswordHistory` any longer.
 * The UDM modules `users/user` and `groups/group` now offer two additional
   UDM properties `univentionObjectIdentifier` and `univentionSourceIAM`.
   `univentionObjectIdentifier` will be used by some apps to track the
   object identity regardless of the source of the object (e.g. either
   `entryUUID` or `objectGUID`) and in a way that is independent of
   implementation of the IAM backend (e.g. OpenLDAP or Active Directory).
