 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A regression introduced in Bug 54883 which caused that `user/ldap` objects
   could not be fetched via the UDM REST API has been corrected.
 * The `pwdChangeNextLogin` property of `users/user` objects was not correctly
   unmapped in case it is not set. This resulted in that it was represented as
   `None` instead of `False` in the UDM REST API.
