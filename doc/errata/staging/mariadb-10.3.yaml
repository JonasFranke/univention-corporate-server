 This update addresses the following issues:
 * InnoDB unspecified vulnerability (CPU Oct 2021) (CVE-2021-35604)
 * Crash executing query with VIEW, aggregate and subquery (CVE-2021-46659)
 * MariaDB allows an application crash in find_field_in_tables and
   find_order_in_list via an unused common table expression (CTE)
   (CVE-2021-46661)
 * Crash in set_var.cc via certain UPDATE queries with nested subqueries
   (CVE-2021-46662)
 * MariaDB through 10.5.13 allows a ha_maria::extra application crash via
   certain SELECT statements (CVE-2021-46663)
 * MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash in
   sub_select_postjoin_aggr for a NULL value of aggr (CVE-2021-46664)
 * MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows a sql_parse.cc application crash because of
   incorrect used_tables expectations (CVE-2021-46665)
 * Integer overflow in sql_lex.cc integer leading to crash (CVE-2021-46667)
 * MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash via certain long SELECT
   DISTINCT statements (CVE-2021-46668)
 * MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine Stack-based Buffer Overflow Privilege
   Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to
   escalate privileges on affected installations of MariaDB. Authentication is
   required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
   processing of SQL queries. The issue results from the lack of proper
   validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a
   fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
   vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the
   context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-16191. (CVE-2022-24048)
 * MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine Use-After-Free Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate
   privileges on affected installations of MariaDB. Authentication is required
   to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
   processing of SQL queries. The issue results from the lack of validating
   the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An
   attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
   arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-16207.
   (CVE-2022-24050)
 * lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it as a
   format specifier (CVE-2022-24051)
 * CONNECT Storage Engine Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerability (CVE-2022-24052)
