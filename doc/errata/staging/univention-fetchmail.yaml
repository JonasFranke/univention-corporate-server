desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The hooks, syntax files and scripts are now installed on the package
   `univention-fetchmail-schema` to avoid errors in installations where
   `univention-fetchmail` is installed on Managed Nodes or Replica Directory
   Nodes.
 * The listener module `fetchmail` now correctly loads the file
   `/etc/fetchmailrc` when there are entries from UIDs with a single character
   or with other valid characters like "'".
