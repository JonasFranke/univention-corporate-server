desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The hooks, syntax files and scripts are now installed
   on the univention-fetchmail-schema package to avoid
   errors in installations where univention-fetchmail
   is installed on Managed Nodes or Replica Directory Nodes.
 * The fetchmail listener now correctly loads /etc/fetchmailrc
   when there are entries from uids with a single character
   or with other valid characters like "'".
