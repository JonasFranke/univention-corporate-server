desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The migration of fetchmail extended attributes has been moved
   to the univenition-fetchmail joinscript to fix errors in environments
   where univention-fetchmail is installed on a non-primary node.
   The old extended attributes have also been restored to fix errors
   in environments where univention-fetchmail is running on a server
   that has not yet been upgraded.
 * New checks have been added to the migrate-fetchmail.py script to
   avoid errors during execution when a fetchmail configuration is
   incomplete.
