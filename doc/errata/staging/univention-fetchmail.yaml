fix: 13.0.6-3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The values of univentionFetchmailSingle and univentionFetchmailMulti
  can't be correctly parsed when the values contain characters like ';'.
  The property is now stored as json to simplify the parsing of the complex
  attribute and avoid errors when non-alphanumeric characters appear.
