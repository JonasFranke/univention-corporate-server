fix: 14.0.10-4A~5.0.0.202208291035
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The mapping now evaluates UCR variables with respect to the configbasename.
   Therefore it is now possible again to create additional AD connector
   instances via `prepare-new-instance`, which was broken since UCS 5.0-0.
 * The function `group_members_sync_to_ucs` used the UCS DN to search in AD,
   this regression introduced in UCS 5.0-0 has been fixed.
 * The connector now synchronizes the password history between AD and UCS.
