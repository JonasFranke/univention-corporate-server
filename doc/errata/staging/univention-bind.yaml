 This update addresses the following issue:
 * DNS zones are now detected by having a `SOA` record instead of having a
   relative name `@`. This is allowed as DNS labels might consist of any 8-bit
   octets including an escaped `\@`. Deleting such entries resulted into the
   complete zone being dropped from BIND9.
