desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-1546: When storing and re-accessing data on a networking channel,
   the length of buffers may have been confused, resulting in an out-of-bounds
   memory read.
 * CVE-2024-1547: Through a series of API calls and redirects, an
   attacker-controlled alert dialog could have been displayed on another
   website (with the victim website's URL shown).
 * CVE-2024-1548: A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by
   using a dropdown select input element. This could have led to user
   confusion and possible spoofing attacks.
 * CVE-2024-1549: If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the
   cursor could have overlapped with the permission dialog, potentially
   resulting in user confusion and unexpected granted permissions.
 * CVE-2024-1550: A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting
   fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to cause the user's mouse to be
   re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and
   inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant.
 * CVE-2024-1551: `Set-Cookie` response headers were being incorrectly honored
   in multipart `HTTP` responses. If an attacker could control the
   `Content-Type` response header, as well as control part of the response
   body, they could inject `Set-Cookie` response headers that would have been
   honored by the browser.
 * CVE-2024-1552: Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected
   numeric conversions and potential undefined behavior. This issue only
   affects 32-bit `ARM` devices.
 * CVE-2024-1553: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, and
   Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
   with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
   code.
