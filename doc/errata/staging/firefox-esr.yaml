 This update addresses the following issues:
 102.13.0esr-1~deb10u1 (Thu, 06 Jul 2023 11:42:05 +0200)
 * Backport to buster.
 * CVE-2023-37201: Use-after-free condition when creating a WebRTC
   connection over HTTPS.
 * CVE-2023-37202: Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy
   could have caused objects from other compartments to be stored in the
   main compartment resulting in a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-37207: A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification
   by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a
   mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing
   attacks.
 * CVE-2023-37208: When opening Diagcab files, Firefox did not warn the user
   that these files may contain malicious code. 
 * CVE-2023-37211: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 114, Firefox ESR
   102.12, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
   memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
   could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
   affects Firefox < 115, Firefox ESR < 102.13, and Thunderbird < 102.13.
