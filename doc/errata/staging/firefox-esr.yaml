 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fixes for mfsa2024-02, also known as: CVE-2024-0741, CVE-2024-0742,
   CVE-2024-0746, CVE-2024-0747, CVE-2024-0749, CVE-2024-0750, CVE-2024-0751,
   CVE-2024-0753, CVE-2024-0755.
 * CVE-2024-0741: An out of bounds write in `ANGLE` could have allowed an
   attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash.
 * CVE-2024-0742: It was possible for certain browser prompts and dialogs
   to be activated or dismissed unintentionally by the user due to an
   incorrect timestamp used to prevent input after page load.
 * CVE-2024-0746: A Linux user opening the print preview dialog could have
   caused the browser to crash.
 * CVE-2024-0747: When a parent page loaded a child in an iframe with
   `unsafe-inline`, the parent Content Security Policy could have overridden
   the child Content Security Policy.
 * CVE-2024-0749: A phishing site could have repurposed an `about:` dialog
   to show phishing content with an incorrect origin in the address bar.
 * CVE-2024-0750: A bug in popup notifications delay calculation could have
   made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting
   permissions.
 * CVE-2024-0751: A malicious devtools extension could have been used to
   escalate privileges.
 * CVE-2024-0753: In specific HSTS configurations an attacker could have
   bypassed HSTS on a subdomain.
 * CVE-2024-0755: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 121, Firefox ESR
   115.6, and Thunderbird 115.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
   corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
   been exploited to run arbitrary code.
