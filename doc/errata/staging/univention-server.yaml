 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The `server_password_change` mechanism has been adjusted
   to first validate that the new machine password successfully
   replicated in OpenLDAP before finally changing the password
   in locally in Samba/AD. Quickly reverting password changes
   in AD is not really possible without breaking DRS replication,
   so it's better to avoid the potential necessity for that.
