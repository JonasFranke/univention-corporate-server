fix: 15.0.8-2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The dependency of `univention-fix-ucr-dns` on `py3dns` has been replaced by
   `dnspython` to support EDNS, which is required for virtual machines on
   AWS-EC2 and OpenStack. This also fixes an issue with "Amazon Provided DNS",
   which only supports "recursive queries": as such they were not identified
   as forwarding DNS services and did not get moved from UCR variables
   `nameserver[123]` to `dns/forwarder[123]`. This resulted in UCS domain
   specific queries being sent wrongly to the "Amazon Provided DNS", which
   then were not able to answer them and returned a failure instead, leading
   to all kind of application errors.
