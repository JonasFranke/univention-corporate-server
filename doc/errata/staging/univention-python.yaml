 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Changing a user password is now possible again when the referenced
   Password History policy did not define values for password length
   or history length.
 * Added the new function `generate_password` that can generate random
   passwords. The new function `password_config` can be used to get parameters
   for that from UCR.
