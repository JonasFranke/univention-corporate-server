desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The log messages of `uldap` are now logged via the Python `logging`
   interface, which is configured to still log to the `univention.debug` log
   stream.  This is a prerequisite for prefixing log lines with the request ID
   in the UDM REST API.
