desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fragmentation cache not cleared on reconnection (CVE-2020-24586)
 * Reassembling fragments encrypted under different keys (CVE-2020-24587)
 * wifi frame payload being parsed incorrectly as an L2 frame (CVE-2020-24588)
 * refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind() (CVE-2020-25670)
 * refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect() (CVE-2020-25671)
 * memory leak in llcp_sock_connect() (CVE-2020-25672)
 * Forwarding EAPOL from unauthenticated wifi client (CVE-2020-26139)
 * reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments (CVE-2020-26147)
 * Passkey Entry protocol of the Bluetooth Core is vulnerable to an
   impersonation attack (CVE-2020-26558)
 * the get_user_pages implementation when used for a copy-on-write page does
   not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can
   grant unintended write access (CVE-2020-29374)
 * Improper access control in BlueZ may allow information disclosure
   vulnerability. (CVE-2021-0129)
 * use-after-free in nosy driver in nosy_ioctl() in drivers/firewire/nosy.c
   when a device is added twice (CVE-2021-3483)
 * Out of bounds memory access bug in get_next_net_page() in fs/f2fs/node.c
   (CVE-2021-3506)
 * double free in bluetooth subsystem when the HCI device initialization fails
   (CVE-2021-3564)
 * use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() (CVE-2021-3573)
 * nfc: Null pointer dereference in llcp_sock_getname (CVE-2021-3587)
 * Race condition in sctp_destroy_sock list_del (CVE-2021-23133)
 * use-after-free in nfc sockets (CVE-2021-23134)
 * The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that
   subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This
   initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite
   pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result
   in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning
   up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All
   Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365
   was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. (CVE-2021-28688)
 * race condition in get_old_root function in fs/btrfs/ctree.c because of a
   lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation
   (CVE-2021-28964)
 * System crash in intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c
   (CVE-2021-28971)
 * Buffer overflow in hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c (CVE-2021-28972)
 * Local privilege escalation due to incorrect BPF JIT branch displacement
   computation (CVE-2021-29154)
 * protection for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations against
   speculatively out-of-bounds loads can be bypassed to leak content of kernel
   memory (CVE-2021-29155)
 * DoS due to negative fragment size calculation in
   drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.c (CVE-2021-29264)
 * information disclosure due to uninitialized data structure in qrtr_recvmsg
   function in net/qrtr/qrtr.c (CVE-2021-29647)
 * lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value in
   net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h may lead to
   DoS (CVE-2021-29650)
 * protection of stack pointer against speculative pointer arithmetic can be
   bypassed to leak content of kernel memory (CVE-2021-31829)
 * out of bounds array access in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c (CVE-2021-31916)
 * race condition for removal of the HCI controller (CVE-2021-32399)
 * use-after-free in net/bluetooth/hci_event.c when destroying an hci_chan
   (CVE-2021-33034)
