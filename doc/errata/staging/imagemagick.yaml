 * Fix CVE-2023-39978: a memory leak was present in Magick::Draw.
 * Mark rmagick test as flaky
 * Fix CVE-2023-1289: A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a
   specially created SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault.
   This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file
   that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp,"
   resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a
   lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains
   many render actions.
 * Fix CVE-2023-34151: A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick, due to
   undefined behaviors of casting double to size_t in svg, mvg and other
   coders.
 * Fix CVE-2023-5341: A heap use-after-free flaw was found in coders/bmp.c
