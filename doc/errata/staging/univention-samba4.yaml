desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The script univention-samba4-site-tool.py attempted to parse the option `-A`
   (for providing an authentication file), which is now already handled by the
   samba package in UCS. This have been fixed.
 * The script s4search-decode can now be used to decode the attribute
   ntPwdHistory.
