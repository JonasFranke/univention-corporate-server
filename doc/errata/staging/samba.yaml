fix: 2:4.16.8-1A~5.0.0.202301062105
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Samba has been updated to version 4.16.8, which fixes vulnerabilities
   caused by the use of the rc4-hmac cipher for session keys.
   In cases where trust relationships between UCS Samba/AD and external
   AD domains have been configured, these may need adjustment. For details
   see the detailed explanation in https://help.univention.com/t/20961 as
   well as the original advisories.
 * Samba 5.16 has a new daemon "samba-dcerpcd" that is started automatically
   on demand by the smbd process. Now the smbd init script also terminates
   this service when the smbd is terminated. This avoids situations, where
   the new daemon would not recognize changes in smb.conf of similar.
