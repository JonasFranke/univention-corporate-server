 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Samba not recognizing some SIDs as valid caused crashes
   of the Microsoft Windows Explorer when opening the security tab
   on a share or file where such SIDs are found in the ACLs. The
   previously applied patch has been accidentally dropped in the
   UCS5 version of Samba.
