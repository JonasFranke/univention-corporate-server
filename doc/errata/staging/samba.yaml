desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Samba has been updated to version 4.16.8, which fixes vulnerabilities
   caused by the use of the rc4-hmac cipher for session keys. Please note
   the detailed explanation in https://help.univention.com/t/20961 as well
   as the original advisories. In cases where trust relationships between
   UCS Samba/AD and external AD domains have been configured, these may
   need adjustment. Please also check if the AD Domain function level of
   your UCS domains are at 2008R2. If they are still on level 2003 then
   the function level needs to be raised before installing the update
   to avoid problems with Kerberos based authentication, as described
   in the help article.
 * Samba 5.16 has a new daemon "samba-dcerpcd" that is started automatically
   on demand by the smbd process. Now the smbd init script also terminates
   this service when the smbd is terminated. This avoids situations, where
   the new daemon would not recognize changes in smb.conf of similar.
