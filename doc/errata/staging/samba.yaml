src: samba
fix: 2:4.18.3-1A~5.0.0.202311271227
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package `samba-ad-dc` now depends on a specific version
   of `samba-dsdb-modules`, to upgrade the initially installed
   version to the one required during installation. This addresses
   issues when an iso was used for installation that did not
   already include the latest samba provided by an errata update.
 * Symbolic links in the sysvol directory will no longer
   break the samba backup tool.
 * The package `samba-ad-dc` now depends on a specific version
   of `samba-ad-provision`, instead of only recommending it.
   This addresses issues when instaling directly from the iso
   that will be released for UCS 5.0-6.
