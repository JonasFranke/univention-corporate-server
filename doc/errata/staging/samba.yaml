desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The modified dependency of `univention-samba3 on `samba-ad-dc`
   which Errata update `#890` introduced, caused `libnss-winbind`
   to be installed. This package modified `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
   adding `winbind` to it. This update reverts that change.
