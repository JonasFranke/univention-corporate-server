desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Opening the security tab in Microsoft Windows Explorer on shares or files
   containing some SIDs considered invalid by Samba caused Samba to crash. The
   patch was accidentally dropped with UCS 5.0 and has been re-applied.
 * The Samba LDAP server process could suffer from a segmentation fault
   in case the LDAP controls paged results or virtual list view are used.
