 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The share setting `map acl inherit = yes` has been broken since UCS 5.0-0
   and is not working properly again.
 * The share configuration of `vfs objects`, `write list`, `hosts allow` and
   `hosts deny` was broken due to too excessive escaping of quotes and has
   been repaired.
