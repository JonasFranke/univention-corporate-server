 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Samba/AD DC in UCS by default is configured with the parameter `obey pam
   restrictions = yes`, to allow the PAM session and account phases to operate
   on share access. This is used for example for automatic home directory
   creation. The corresponding PAM stack `samba` simply includes the generic
   `common-account` and `common-session` files, which make use of `pam_krb5`
   by default. This led to a situation where `pam_krb5` is run as part of the
   normal Samba login. Since that PAM module is linked to the Debian heimdal
   base libraries which are using `pthreads` but Samba is using heimdal
   libraries without `pthreads` over time this could lead to an resource
   depletion issue internal to `pthreads` and finally causing an `smbd` panic.
   To avoid this, we now adjusted the `common-account` and `common-session`
   files to skip `pam_krb5` for the service `samba`. At the point where these
   PAM modules are run in the context of Samba/AD, the authentication and
   Kerberos handling has already been done, so there is no point using
   `pam_krb5` functions in this case anyway.
