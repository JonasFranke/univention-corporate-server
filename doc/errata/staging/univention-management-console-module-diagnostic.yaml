desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A new diagnostic routine was added to check and optionally to reestablish
   the correctness of the repository configuration. The following checks are
   performed:
   1. It is checked, if there are deprecated variables still defined. In this
      case by pressing the "ADJUST ALL COMPONENTS" button the merge process
      which is also done in the repository setting module is executed by the
      diagnostic routine including the deletion of the deprecated variables.
   2. It is checked if there are repository/online/server or
      /repository/online/component/*/server UCR variables having a scheme
      other than http or https. This can only be corrected manually using
      either the repository settings module or the UCR module to directly
      modify the variables. This second check can be disabled by defining
      an UCR variable 'diagnostic/check/65_check_repository_config/ignore'
      to any non empty value.
