 This update addresses the following issue:
 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u4 (Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:44:35 +0000)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the Debian LTS team.
 * CVE-2023-52160: Prevent a potential authentication bypass vulnerability in
   the PEAP protocol implementation. For an attack to have been successful,
   wpa_supplicant must have been configured to not verify the network's TLS
   certificate during Phase 1 of the authentication cycle; a eap_peap_decrypt
   vulnerability could have been used to skip Phase 2 authentication by
   sending an EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase 2.
