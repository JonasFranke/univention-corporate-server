 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-52160: Prevent a potential authentication bypass vulnerability in
   the PEAP protocol implementation. For an attack to have been successful,
   `wpa_supplicant` must have been configured to not verify the network's TLS
   certificate during Phase 1 of the authentication cycle; a
   `eap_peap_decrypt` vulnerability could have been used to skip Phase 2
   authentication by sending an EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting
   Phase 2.
