desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 4.6-1+deb10u9 (Mon, 08 Jan 2024 23:02:12 +0100)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-50269, CVE-2023-49286, CVE-2023-49285, CVE-2023-46847,
   CVE-2023-46846.
 * Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, a full
   featured web proxy cache. Due to programming errors in Squid's HTTP request
   parsing, remote attackers may be able to execute a denial of service attack
   by sending large X-Forwarded-For header or trigger a stack buffer overflow
   while performing HTTP Digest authentication. Other issues facilitate
   request smuggling past a firewall or a denial of service against Squid's
   Helper process management. In regard to CVE-2023-46728: Please note that
   support for the Gopher protocol has simply been removed in future Squid
   versions. There is no fix available. We recommend to reject all gopher URL
   requests instead.
