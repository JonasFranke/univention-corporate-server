desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The SAML identity cache has been changed to an in-memory cache. This
   can be changed to the filesystem database by setting the UCR variable
   `umc/saml/in-memory-identity-cache` to `false`. This is done automatically
   for servers with enabled multiprocessing.
