 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Disable the SOAP binding for single sign-out in the
   identity provider metadata to make sure we don't use
   SOAP for the UMC SAML logout.
 * The joinscript now uses Python 3 instead of Python 2 to update
   SAML metadata. Future compatibility with Python 3.11 has been added.
