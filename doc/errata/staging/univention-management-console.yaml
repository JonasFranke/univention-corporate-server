fix: 12.0.31-11
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Aborted HTTP requests do not close the socket connection to still opened
   UMC module processes anymore but wait until the session times out.
 * New Python APIs for modules are provided which help in replacing
   `python-notifier`.
 * The link to the Univention Wiki has been removed because it's deprecated
   and planned for going offline.
