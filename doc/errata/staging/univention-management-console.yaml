desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The UCR variable `ldap/server/sasl/mech_list` has been added to allow
   restricting the list of SASL mechanisms that the local LDAP server
   offers. By default GSS-SPNEGO and NTLM get disabled with the update,
   because they don't work properly with slapd in UCS.
