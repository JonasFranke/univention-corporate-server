desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The UMC ACL's are now loaded from the local LDAP server again.
   This was broken since UCS 5.0-4.
 * The Self-Service on DC Backups were broken since UCS 5.0-4 as it forwards
   all incoming requests to the DC Primary. These requests contained a broken
   request path leading to 403 Forbidden error messages saying "No module
   found for this request.".
