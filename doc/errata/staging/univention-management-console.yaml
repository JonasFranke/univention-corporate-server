desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * For UCS 5.0-3 the UMC services where converted to systemd. These services
   are essential to continue running even when updates are installed from UMC.
   Due to an oversight the first erratum 583 triggered a latent bug, which
   causes the service to stop during the upgrade, which kills any web session
   and abort the update process running in the background. This update adds a
   mitigation to prevent the service from stopping during the update.
 * A missing Python 2.7 dependency has been added so that UMC modules using
   Python 2.7 work again.
