desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Notifier sometimes failed to process all transaction in bulk and
   aborted. This lead to the Notifier making no progress and filling the log
   file with the same error messages again and again. Transactions are now
   processes incrementally.
 * Several memory issues have been fixed.
