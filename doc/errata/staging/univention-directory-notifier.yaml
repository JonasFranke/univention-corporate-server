desc: |
  This update addresses the following issue:
  * Implement `univention-translog reinex` to re-built the transaction index
    file in case it gets corrupted. Univention Directory Notifier already has
    code to do maintain the index, but after certain error cases the index may
    become corrupt and has to be re-built. The code in UDN is not optimized to
    re-index many transactions in batch and shows performance issues for large
    transaction files.
