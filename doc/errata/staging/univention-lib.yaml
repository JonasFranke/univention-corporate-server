 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In case an LDAP ACL or schema extension got installed by a joinscript
   by running `ucs_registerLDAPExtension` and it was not activated for some
   reason (e.g. because the slapd was not running at the time when the
   postrun of the `ldap_extension` listener module was running)
   a rerun of `univention-run-join-scripts` did not change anything.
   Now `ucs_registerLDAPExtension` has been adjusted to do a trivial
   (i.e. no-op) LDAP modification to re-trigger activation.
