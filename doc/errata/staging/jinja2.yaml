 * Non-maintainer upload by the Debian LTS team.
 * CVE-2024-22195: Fix an issue where it was possible to inject arbitrary HTML
   attributes into the rendered HTML via the "xmlattr" filter, potentially
   leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. It may also have been
   possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they were
   blacklist-based.
