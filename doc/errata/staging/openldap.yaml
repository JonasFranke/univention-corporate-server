desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The behavior of the `translog` overlay was modified to skip grandchildren
   of the `cn=temporary,cn=univention` container.
   This new behavior can be controlled by the UCR variable
   `ldap/translog-ignore-temporary`.
   This reduces the number of replication transactions during creation of
   users and groups significantly. As a result it increases the replication
   performance and reduces the rate at which the cn=translog LMDB backend
   database gets filled.
   This variable is applicable only to the UCS Primary Directory Node.
   The package `univention-ldap-server` activates this variable by default.
