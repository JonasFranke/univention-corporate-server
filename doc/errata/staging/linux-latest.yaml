 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.19.235, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * Improper lock operation in btrfs (CVE-2021-4149)
 * Improper lock operation in btrfs (CVE-2021-4149)
 * blkfront: CVE-2022-23036
 * netfront: CVE-2022-23037
 * scsifront: CVE-2022-23038
 * gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039
 * xenbus: CVE-2022-23040
 * blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and
   pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until
   it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not
   synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can
   keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then
   re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a
   BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will
   result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be
   triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042 (CVE-2022-23036)
 * cpu: arm64: Spectre-BHB (CVE-2022-23960)
 * Use-after-free in dev->buf release in drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c
   (CVE-2022-24958)
