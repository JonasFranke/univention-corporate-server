fix: 105+deb10u21
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-34319: The fix for `XSA-423` added logic to Linux'es netback
   driver to deal with a frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not
   all of the headers would come in one piece. Unfortunately the logic
   introduced there didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet
   being split into as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still
   being smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all
   (possible) headers together. Such an unusual packet would therefore
   trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.
 * CVE-2023-3212: A `NULL` pointer dereference issue was found in the
   `gfs2` file system in the Linux kernel. It occurs on corrupt `gfs2` file
   systems when the evict code tries to reference the journal descriptor
   structure after it has been freed and set to `NULL`. A privileged local
   user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic.
 * CVE-2023-3390: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux
   kernel's netfilter subsystem in `net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c`.
   Mishandled error handling with `NFT_MSG_NEWRULE` makes it possible to use
   a dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free
   vulnerability. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause
   a privilege escalation issue.
 * CVE-2023-35001: Linux Kernel `nftables` Out-Of-Bounds Read/Write
   Vulnerability; `nft_byteorder` poorly handled vm register contents when
   `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is in any user or network namespace.
 * CVE-2023-1206: A hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection
   lookup table in the Linux kernel’s IPv6 functionality when a user makes a
   new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or with
   a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that
   accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.
 * CVE-2023-3776: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
   escalation. If `tcf_change_indev()` fails, `fw_set_parms()` will
   immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the
   reference counter in `tcf_bind_filter()`. If an attacker can control the
   reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be
   freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
 * CVE-2023-3611: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux
   kernel's `net/sched`: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. The `qfq_change_agg()` function in
   `net/sched/sch_qfq.c` allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax is
   updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks.
 * CVE-2023-3609: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `cls_u32` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. If `tcf_change_indev()` fails, `u32_set_parms()`
   will immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the
   reference counter in `tcf_bind_filter()`. If an attacker can control the
   reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be
   freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
 * CVE-2023-4208: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `cls_u32` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. When `u32_change()` is called on an existing filter,
   the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the
   filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as
   `tcf_unbind_filter()` is always called on the old instance in the success
   path, decreasing `filter_cnt` of the still referenced class and allowing
   it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-4206: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `cls_route` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. When `route4_change()` is called on an existing
   filter, the whole `tcf_result` struct is always copied into the new
   instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound
   to a class, as `tcf_unbind_filter()` is always called on the old instance
   in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class
   and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-40283: An issue was discovered in `l2cap_sock_release` in
   `net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c` in the Linux kernel before 6.4.10. There is a
   use-after-free because the children of an sk are mishandled.
 * CVE-2023-39194: A flaw was found in the `XFRM` subsystem in the Linux
   kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters,
   which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw
   allows a local privileged (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`) attacker to trigger an
   out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure.
 * CVE-2023-3772: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s IP framework for
   transforming packets (`XFRM` subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious
   user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges to directly dereference a `NULL`
   pointer in `xfrm_update_ae_params()`, leading to a possible kernel crash
   and denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-4244: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   netfilter: `nf_tables` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between `nf_tables` netlink
   control plane transaction and `nft_set` element garbage collection, it is
   possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free
   vulnerability.
 * CVE-2023-4622: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `af_unix` component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
   escalation. The `unix_stream_sendpage()` function tries to add data to the
   last skb in the peer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is
   a race where `unix_stream_sendpage()` could access an `skb locklessly`
   that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-1077: In the Linux kernel, `pick_next_rt_entity()` may return a
   type confused entry, not detected by the `BUG_ON` condition, as the
   confused entry will not be `NULL`, but list_head.The buggy error condition
   would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be
   used as a type confused `sched_rt_entity`,causing memory corruption.
 * CVE-2023-1989: A use-after-free flaw was found in `btsdio_remove` in
   `drivers\bluetooth\btsdio.c` in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to
   `btsdio_remove` with an unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading
   to a `UAF` on hdev devices.
 * CVE-2023-4623: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `sch_hfsc` (`HFSC` qdisc traffic control) component can be
   exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a
   link-sharing curve (i.e. with the `HFSC_FSC` flag set) has a parent
   without a link-sharing curve, then `init_vf()` will call `vttree_insert()`
   on the parent, but `vttree_remove()` will be skipped in `update_vf()`.
   This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-42753: An array indexing vulnerability was found in the
   netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a
   miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the
   primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound.
   This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially
   escalate their privileges on the system.
 * CVE-2023-39192: A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux
   kernel. The `xt_u32` module did not validate the fields in the `xt_u32`
   structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an
   out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the
   array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.
 * CVE-2023-39193: A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux
   kernel. The `sctp_mt_check` did not validate the `flag_count` field. This
   flaw allows a local privileged (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`) attacker to trigger an
   out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.
 * CVE-2023-45871: An issue was discovered in
   `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c` in the IGB driver in the Linux
   kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger
   than the MTU.
 * CVE-2023-4921: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `sch_qfq` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. When the plug `qdisc` is used as a class of the `qfq
   qdisc`, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in `qfq_dequeue()`
   due to the incorrect `.peek` handler of `sch_plug` and lack of error
   checking in `agg_dequeue()`.
 * CVE-2023-39189: A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux
   kernel. The `nfnl_osf_add_callback` function did not validate the user
   mode controlled `opt_num` field. This flaw allows a local privileged
   (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a
   crash or information disclosure.
 * CVE-2023-4207: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   `net/sched`: `cls_fw` component can be exploited to achieve local
   privilege escalation. When `fw_change()` is called on an existing filter,
   the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the
   filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as
   `tcf_unbind_filter()` is always called on the old instance in the success
   path, decreasing `filter_cnt` of the still referenced class and allowing
   it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-42755: A flaw was found in the IPv4 Resource Reservation
   Protocol (`RSVP`) classifier in the Linux kernel. The `xprt` pointer may
   go beyond the linear part of the `skb`, leading to an out-of-bounds read
   in the `rsvp_classify` function. This issue may allow a local user to
   crash the system and cause a denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-42754: A `NULL` pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux
   kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (`skb`) was assumed to be associated
   with a device before calling `__ip_options_compile`, which is not always
   the case if the `skb` is re-routed by `ipvs`. This issue may allow a local
   user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges to crash the system.
 * CVE-2023-34324: Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can
   result in a deadlock. This happens when the close is being performed in
   parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen
   console interrupt in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event
   channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other
   side. As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other
   side quite often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not
   neglectable. Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit
   Linux kernel on Arm doesn't use `queued-RW-locks`, which are required to
   trigger the issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers
   to get the lock).
 * CVE-2023-5717: A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux
   kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (`perf`) component can be
   exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If `perf_read_group()` is
   called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's
   sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the
   allocated buffer.
 * CVE-2023-45863: An issue was discovered in `lib/kobject.c` in the Linux
   kernel before 6.2.3. With root access, an attacker can trigger a race
   condition that results in a `fill_kobj_path` out-of-bounds write.
 * CVE-2021-44879: In `gc_data_segment` in `fs/f2fs/gc.c` in the Linux
   kernel before 5.16.3, special files are not considered, leading to a
   `move_data_page` `NULL` pointer dereference.
 * CVE-2023-0590: A use-after-free flaw was found in `qdisc_graft` in
   `net/sched/sch_api.c` in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw
   leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 ("net: sched:
   fix race condition in qdisc_graft()") not applied yet, then kernel could
   be affected.
 * CVE-2023-25775: Improper access control in the Intel(R) Ethernet
   Controller `RDMA` driver for linux before version 1.9.30 may allow an
   unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via
   network access.
 * CVE-2023-6932: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
   ipv4: `igmp` component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
   escalation. A race condition can be exploited to cause a timer be
   mistakenly registered on a `RCU` read locked object which is freed by
   another thread.
 * CVE-2023-6931: A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux
   kernel's Performance Events system component can be exploited to achieve
   local privilege escalation. A `perf_event's` `read_size` can overflow,
   leading to an heap out-of-bounds increment or write in
   `perf_read_group()`.
 * CVE-2023-51780: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before
   6.6.8. `do_vcc_ioctl` in `net/atm/ioctl.c` has a use-after-free because of
   a `vcc_recvmsg` race condition.
 * CVE-2023-51782: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before
   6.6.8. `rose_ioctl` in `net/rose/af_rose.c` has a use-after-free because
   of a rose_accept race condition.
 * CVE-2023-51781: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before
   6.6.8. `atalk_ioctl` in `net/appletalk/ddp.c` has a use-after-free because
   of an `atalk_recvmsg` race condition.
 * CVE-2023-6606: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in
   `smbCalcSize` in `fs/smb/client/netmisc.c` in the Linux Kernel. This issue
   could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel
   information.
note: This is the 2nd of three parts.
