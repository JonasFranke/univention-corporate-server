 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.19.269, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * Use-after-free in `nilfs_mdt_destroy` (CVE-2022-2978)
 * Race condition in `kcm_tx_work()` in `net/kcm/kcmsock.c` (CVE-2022-3521)
 * Memory leak in `ipv6_renew_options()` (CVE-2022-3524)
 * Use-after-free caused by `l2cap_reassemble_sdu()` in
   `net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c` (CVE-2022-3564)
 * Use-after-free in `l1oip` timer handlers (CVE-2022-3565)
 * Rate limit overflow messages in `r8152` in intr_callback (CVE-2022-3594)
 * nilfs2: NULL pointer dereference in `nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level` in
   `fs/nilfs2/inode.c` (CVE-2022-3621)
 * A USB-accessible buffer overflow in `brcmfmac` (CVE-2022-3628)
 * Use -fter-free flaw in `l2cap_conn_del` in `net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c`
   (CVE-2022-3640)
 * Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback. It is
   possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a
   Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears
   to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack
   that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of
   the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been
   reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780
   (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case
   the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward
   those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,
   resulting in said misbehavior. (CVE-2022-3643)
 * nilfs2: memory leak in `nilfs_attach_log_writer` in `fs/nilfs2/segment.c`
   (CVE-2022-3646)
 * nilfs2: use-after-free in `nilfs_new_inode` of `fs/nilfs2/inode.c`
   (CVE-2022-3649)
 * kernel: a stack overflow in `do_proc_dointvec` and `proc_skip_spaces`
   (CVE-2022-4378)
 * v4l2-mem2mem: Apply `DST_QUEUE_OFF_BASE` on MMAP buffers across ioctls
   (CVE-2022-20369)
 * cpu: Intel: RetBleed Arbitrary Speculative Code Execution with Return
   Instructions (CVE-2022-29901)
 * Leak of sensitive information due to uninitialized data in
   `stex_queuecommand_lck()` in `drivers/scsi/stex.c` (CVE-2022-40768)
 * A race between `ufx_ops_open()` and `ufx_usb_disconnect()` may result in
   use-after-free (CVE-2022-41849)
 * Race condition in `roccat_report_event` in `drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c`
   (CVE-2022-41850)
 * Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver. The patch for XSA-392
   introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to
   free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling
   (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the
   same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface
   the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).
 * Information leak in `l2cap_parse_conf_req` in `net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c`
   (CVE-2022-42895)
 * Use-after-free in `l2cap_connect` and `l2cap_le_connect_req` in
   `net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c` (CVE-2022-42896)
 * Memory corruption in usbmon driver (CVE-2022-43750)
note: This is the 3rd of three parts.
