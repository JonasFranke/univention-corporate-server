desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 2.06-3~deb10u3 (Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:19:43 +0000)
 [ Steve McIntyre ]
 * Actually ensure the patches are applied for CVE-2022-2601 and
   CVE-2022-3775.
 * Include fonts in the memdisk build for EFI images.
 * Fix bug in core file code so errors are handled better. This makes the
   fallback font-handling patch work properly.
 * Bump Debian SBAT level to 4 - Due to a mistake in the buster upload
   (2.06-3~deb10u2) that left the CVE-2022-2601 bugs in place, we need to bump
   SBAT for all of the Debian GRUB binaries. :-(
