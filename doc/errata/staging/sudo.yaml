 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-7090: A flaw was found in sudo in the handling of `ipa_hostname`,
   where `ipa_hostname` from `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` was not propagated in
   `sudo`. Therefore, it leads to privilege mismanagement vulnerability in
   applications, where client hosts retain privileges even after retracting
   them.

 * CVE-2023-28487: `sudo` did not escape control characters in `sudoreplay`
