desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The script `univention-directory-replication` created a
   temporary password file with a newline in it, which therefore
   contained an invalid password. This resulted in slapd not being
   able to import a failed.ldif file on startup.
   his fixes as regression from erratum 870.
