desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 1.24.1-1+deb10u1 (Sat, 07 Oct 2023 18:59:08 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
 * Follow-up for CVE-2018-20060: Remove Authorization headers regardless of
   case on cross-origin redirects.
 * Fix CVE-2019-11236: An attacker controlling the request parameter can
   inject headers by injecting CR/LF characters.
 * Fix CVE-2019-11324: When verifying HTTPS connections when an SSLContext is
   passed to urllib3, system CA certificates will be loaded into the
   SSLContext by default in addition to any manually-specified CA
   certificates. This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the
   manually specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.

 * Fix CVE-2020-26137: CRLF injection vulnerability when the attacker controls
   the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control
   characters in the first argument of putrequest().
 * Fix CVE-2023-43804: Cookie request header isn't stripped during
   cross-origin redirects.
