fix: 1.24.1-1+deb10u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2018-20060: Remove Authorization headers regardless of case on
   cross-origin redirects.
 * CVE-2019-11236: An attacker controlling the request parameter can inject
   headers by injecting CR/LF characters.
 * CVE-2019-11324: When verifying HTTPS connections when an `SSLContext` is
   passed to `urllib3`, system CA certificates will be loaded into the
   `SSLContext` by default in addition to any manually-specified CA
   certificates. This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the
   manually specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.
 * CVE-2020-26137: CRLF injection vulnerability when the attacker controls the
   HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control
   characters in the first argument of `putrequest()`.
 * CVE-2023-43804: Cookie request header isn't stripped during cross-origin
   redirects.
