 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-48795: ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart
   the so-called "Terrapin attack" discovered by Fabian Bäumer, Marcus
   Brinkmann and Jörg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited
   break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by
   sending extra messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and
   deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
   encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect
   that messages were deleted.
 * CVE-2023-51385: ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained
   shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
   directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u,
   %h or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
   user/hostnames to ssh(1) could potentially perform command injection
   depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied ssh_config(5)
   directive. ssh(1) now bans most shell metacharacters from user and
   hostnames supplied via the command-line.
 * CVE-2021-41617: sshd(8) from OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.7 failed to correctly
   initialise supplemental groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
   AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
   AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command
   as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit the groups that
   sshd(8) was started with.
