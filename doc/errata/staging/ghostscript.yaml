 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Buffer overflow leading to potential corruption of data internal to the
   PostScript interpreter, in `base/sbcp.c`. This affects `BCPEncode`,
   `BCPDecode`, `TBCPEncode`, and `TBCPDecode`. If the write buffer is filled
   to one byte less than full, and one then tries to write an escaped
   character, two bytes are written. (CVE-2023-28879)
