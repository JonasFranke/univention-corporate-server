fix: 1.0.6A~5.0.0.202301161624
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The `univention-keycloak` script didn't evaluate the app setting
   `keycloak/server/sso/fqdn`. Due to this, the joinscript of the Keycloak app
   failed if this setting is set.
 * Many options of the `univention-keycloak` script can now be passed on the
   command line. `univention-config-registry` is not required anymore, but
   only gives sane defaults.
