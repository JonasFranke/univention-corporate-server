fix: 1.0.9-7A~5.0.0.202303211910
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The command `upgrade-config` has been added to
   `univention-keycloak`. This is used during upgrades
   of the keycloak app to update the domain wide
   keycloak configuration.
 * `Content-Security-Policy` is removed from `UCS` realm init config,
   since it is handled by `apache` configuration.
