fix: 1.0.9-28
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * It is now possible to set `Keycloak`clients
   authentication flow using the `client-auth-flow`
   option. Passing an empty string will reset the flow
   to the default browser flow.
 * The command `legacy-authentication-flow` has been added
   to create an authentication flow which will enable app specific
   authorization in a future version of the `Keycloak App`.
