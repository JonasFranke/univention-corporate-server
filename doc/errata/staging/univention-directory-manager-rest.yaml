 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When computer objects were assigned with a network the DHCP and DNS
   settings weren't saved if a custom IP was specified. This has been
   corrected.
 * Accessing objects which contain UTF-8 characters in their LDAP DN
   was impossible and has been fixed.
 * The displayed description of objects is now more accurate,
   for example for OX IMAP folder objects did not include
   the domain name which made it difficult to differentiate
   folder names for different domains.
