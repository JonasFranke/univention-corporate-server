fix:
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The OpenAPI schema of the UDM REST API has been improved:
   Nested properties are now described more detailed while they previously
   were only descrived as free form objects. Data deduplication has been
   made by referencing global data instead of including them. All possible
   HTTP errors are listed in the responses. Experimental features like
   pagination during search have been added as deprecated so that they
   can be used more easily in the future when UCS supports them.
   Various parameters are now created via code introspection.
bug: [55096]
