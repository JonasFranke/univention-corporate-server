fix:
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The performance of the UDM REST API has been improoved:
   A duplicated LDAP search has been eliminated for `GET`, `PATCH` and
   `DELETE` operations on a object.
 * The LDAP connections for read and write operations have been separated and
   are now individually configurable via the UCR variables
   `directory/manager/rest/ldap-connection/.*/.*`.
