 This update addresses the following issue:

 * 7.4.4+dfsg-6+deb9u1 (Sun, 04 Mar 2018 12:49:11 +0100) [Sven Hartge] * Let
   PID files be owned by root. Mitigates a minor security problem similar to
   CVE 2017-14610. Note that this change disables automatic tracebacks.
   [Carsten Leonhardt] * Added transitional package bacula-director-common,
   the old leftover package can't be safely purged otherwise (it deletes
   /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf in postrm which now belongs to the
   bacula-director package). For the case when the package
   bacula-director-common is deinstalled but not purged, we neutralize the
   offending postrm script when upgrading bacula-common. (Closes: #880529)

 * In Bareos Director less than or equal to 16.2.10, 17.2.9, 18.2.8, and
   19.2.7, a heap overflow allows a malicious client to corrupt the director's
   memory via oversized digest strings sent during initialization of a verify
   job. Disabling verify jobs mitigates the problem. This issue is also
   patched in Bareos versions 19.2.8, 18.2.9 and 17.2.10. (CVE-2020-11061)
