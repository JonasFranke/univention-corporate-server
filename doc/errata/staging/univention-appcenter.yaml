fix: 9.0.7-10
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Some installation code is now executed with Python 3 instead of Python 2.
   Future compatibility with Python 3.11 has been added.
 * The App Center listener now removes files from its queue that contain
   entryUUIDs whose corresponding UDM objects cannot be found. These
   files cannot be processed by the listener and would otherwise remain in
   the queue forever and cause infinite error logging.
