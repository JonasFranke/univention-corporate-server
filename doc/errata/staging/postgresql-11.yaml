desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 11.21-0+deb10u2 (Mon, 02 Oct 2023 16:15:27 +0200)
 * Fix changelog of last upload, the original version mistakenly repeated the
   information from 11.20.
 11.22-0+deb10u1 (Tue, 07 Nov 2023 14:50:52 +0100)
 * New upstream version. * This is expected to be the last PostgreSQL release
   in the 11.X series. Users are encouraged to update to a newer release
   branch soon. * Fix handling of unknown-type arguments in DISTINCT "any"
   aggregate functions (Tom Lane) This error led to a text-type value being
   interpreted as an unknown-type value (that is, a zero-terminated string) at
   runtime. This could result in disclosure of server memory following the
   text value. The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jingzhou Fu for reporting this
   problem. (CVE-2023-5868) * Detect integer overflow while computing new
   array dimensions (Tom Lane) When assigning new elements to array subscripts
   that are outside the current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow
   could occur in edge cases. Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable
   for arbitrary code execution are possible, and so is disclosure of server
   memory. The PostgreSQL Project thanks Pedro Gallegos for reporting this
   problem. (CVE-2023-5869) * Prevent the pg_signal_backend role from
   signalling background workers and autovacuum processes (Noah Misch, Jelte
   Fennema-Nio) The documentation says that pg_signal_backend cannot issue
   signals to superuser-owned processes. It was able to signal these
   background processes, though, because they advertise a role OID of zero.
   Treat that as indicating superuser ownership. The security implications of
   cancelling one of these process types are fairly small so far as the core
   code goes (we'll just start another one), but extensions might add
   background workers that are more vulnerable. Also ensure that the
   is_superuser parameter is set correctly in such processes. No specific
   security consequences are known for that oversight, but it might be
   significant for some extensions. The PostgreSQL Project thanks Hemanth
   Sandrana and Mahendrakar Srinivasarao for reporting this problem.
   (CVE-2023-5870)
 * Rebase debian/patches/libpgport-pkglibdir.
