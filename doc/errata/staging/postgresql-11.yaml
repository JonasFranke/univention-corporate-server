 This update addresses the following issues:
 11.20-0+deb10u1 (Wed, 10 May 2023 21:04:02 +0200)
 * New upstream version. + Prevent CREATE SCHEMA from defeating changes in
   search_path (Report and fix by Alexander Lakhin, CVE-2023-2454) Within a
   CREATE SCHEMA command, objects in the prevailing search_path, as well as
   those in the newly-created schema, would be visible even within a called
   function or script that attempted to set a secure search_path. This could
   allow any user having permission to create a schema to hijack the
   privileges of a security definer function or extension script. + Enforce
   row-level security policies correctly after inlining a set-returning
   function (Report by Wolfgang Walther, CVE-2023-2455) If a set-returning
   SQL-language function refers to a table having row-level security policies,
   and it can be inlined into a calling query, those RLS policies would not
   get enforced properly in some cases involving re-using a cached plan under
   a different role. This could allow a user to see or modify rows that should
   have been invisible.
