desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The detection whether a user is a fetchmail user (by checking if
   they have a mailPrimaryAddress) during modifications of users has been
   repaired. Therefore when the mailPrimaryAddress is changed or removed
   the correct changes are synchronized to fetchmail.
 * Deleting fetchmail configurations of a user now correctly removes
   entries from the fetchmailrc file in case they are the last ones.
 * Narrowed down the conditions under which the listener module gets
   called.
