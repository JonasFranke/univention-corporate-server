 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The UMC ACL's are now loaded from the local LDAP server again.
   This was broken since UCS 5.0-4.
 * The Self-Service was broken on DC Backups since UCS 5.0-4 because incoming
   requests that were forwarded to the DC Primary contained broken request
   paths that led to 403 Forbidden error messages saying "No module found
   for this request.".
