 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-4883: When processing files with `.Z` or `.gz` extensions, the
   library calls external programs to compress and uncompress files, relying
   on the `PATH` environment variable to find these programs, which could
   allow a malicious user to execute other programs by manipulating the `PATH`
   environment variable.
 * CVE-2022-44617: When processing a file with width of 0 and a very large
   height, some parser functions will be called repeatedly and can lead to an
   infinite loop, resulting in a Denial-of-Service in the application linked
   to the library.
 * CVE-2022-46285: When parsing a file with a comment not closed an
   end-of-file condition will not be detected, leading to an infinite loop and
   resulting in a Denial-of-Service in the application linked to the library.
