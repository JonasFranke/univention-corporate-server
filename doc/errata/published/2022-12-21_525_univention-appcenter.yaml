fix: 9.0.3-7A~5.0.0.202212071136
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The Repository Setting module got now additional logic to support the
   merging of the following UCR variables which got an deprecated state:
   repository/online/(prefix, port)
   repository/online/component/*/(prefix, port, username, password)
 * When entering the Repository Settings module and these variables exist,
   they will be merged into the corresponding 'server' variables. The inputs
   fields for the deprecated variables where deleted as their contents is
   reflected in the 'server' variable only.
   This is the case for the general repository settings as well as for the
   settings for the additional repositories.
 * When pressing the Apply Changes button the merged 'server' UCR variable
   is updated and the deprecated UCR variables are deleted. This is true
   for the general repository settings as well as for the settings for the
   additional repositories. If the scheme in the 'server' variable is
   different to http or https an error message is raised, the 'server'
   variable is not updated and the deprecated variables are not deleted.
 * The help text of `univention-app configure` has been fixed so that the
   usage prints the allowed arguments in the correct positional order.
