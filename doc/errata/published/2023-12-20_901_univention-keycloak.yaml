version: [5, 6]
scope: ucs_5.0-0-errata5.0-6
src: univention-keycloak
fix: 1.0.10-3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package `univention-keycloak` ships the command line
   script `univention-keycloak-migration-status` which is used
   before the update to UCS 5.2 to check whether the migration
   to keycloak is complete. The requirement to install the
   keycloak app before the update has been dropped. The update
   to UCS 5.2 will be possible without the installation of the
   keycloak app.
 * Commands to manage proxy realms (supplemental logical IDP's
   in keycloak that authenticate users on the default IDP) have
   been added to `univention-keycloak`.
