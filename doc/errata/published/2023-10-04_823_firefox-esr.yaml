   freed and a reference to that object remained. This resulted in a
   potentially exploitable condition when the reference to that object was
   later reused. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.
 * CVE-2023-37210: A website could prevent a user from exiting full-screen
   mode via alert and prompt calls. This could lead to user confusion and
   possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.

   effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
   vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.
 * CVE-2023-34414: Click-jacking certificate exceptions through rendering
   lag.
 * CVE-2023-34415: When choosing a site-isolated process for a document
   loaded from a data: URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would
   load that document in the same process as the site that issued the
   redirect. This bypassed the site-isolation protections against
   Spectre-like attacks on sites that host an "open redirect". Firefox no
   longer follows HTTP redirects to data: URLs. This vulnerability affects

   privileged principal. In certain circumstances it might have been possible
   to cause a document to be loaded with a higher privileged principal than
   intended. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 113.

   should have silently failed. This could have led to a desynchronization in
   expected results when reading from the secure cookie. This vulnerability
   affects Firefox for Android < 112, Firefox < 112, and Focus for Android <
   112.
 * CVE-2023-29548: Incorrect optimization result on ARM64.
 * CVE-2023-29549: Under certain circumstances, a call to the
   <code>bind</code> function may have resulted in the incorrect realm. This

   to use the Camera, were granted to a document loaded using a file: URL,
   that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from
   a file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from
   different sources, such as in a download directory. This vulnerability
   affects Firefox < 111.

   zero-length, the value was not written to an invalid memory address. This
   vulnerability affects Firefox < 104.

 * CVE-2022-36320: Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported
   memory safety bugs present in Firefox 102. Some of these bugs showed

   vulnerability affects Firefox < 103.
 * CVE-2022-2505: CVE-2022-2505 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in
   Firefox 103 and 102.1.
