 This update addresses the following issues:
 * iframe sandbox bypass with XSLT (CVE-2021-4140)
 * iframe sandbox rules did not apply to XSLT stylesheets (CVE-2021-38503)
 * Use-after-free in file picker dialog (CVE-2021-38504)
 * Firefox could be coaxed into going into full-screen mode without
   notification or warning (CVE-2021-38506)
 * Opportunistic encryption in HTTP2 could be used to bypass the
   Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports (CVE-2021-38507)

   potential spoofing (CVE-2021-38508)
 * JavaScript alert box could have been spoofed onto an arbitrary domain
   (CVE-2021-38509)
 * Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs. Some
   of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
   enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
   code. (CVE-2021-43534)
 * A use-after-free could have occurred when an HTTP2 session object was
   released on a different thread, leading to memory corruption and a
   potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2021-43535)
 * URL leakage when navigating while executing asynchronous function
   (CVE-2021-43536)
 * Heap buffer overflow when using structured clone (CVE-2021-43537)

 * XMLHttpRequest error codes could have leaked the existence of an external
   protocol handler (CVE-2021-43542)
 * Bypass of CSP sandbox directive when embedding (CVE-2021-43543)
 * Denial of Service when using the Location API in a loop (CVE-2021-43545)
 * Cursor spoofing could overlay user interface when native cursor is zoomed
   (CVE-2021-43546)
 * Race condition when playing audio files (CVE-2022-22737)
 * Heap-buffer-overflow in `blendGaussianBlur` (CVE-2022-22738)
