desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The function `group_members_sync_to_ucs` used a UCS DN to search in Samba,
   which usually doesn't cause issues, as long as the group object is located
   in the same position.
 * The connector now synchronizes the password history between Samba and UCS.
