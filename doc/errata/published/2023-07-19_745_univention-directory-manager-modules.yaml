fix: 15.0.24-13
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Nested lists (e.g. links of portal entries) are now parsed correctly by the
   UDM REST API server.
 * Under certain circumstances the users/user module could skip updating the
   `univentionLastUsedValue` attribute at the `cn=uidNumber` object in LDAP.
   This has been corrected.
