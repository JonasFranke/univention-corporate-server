 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2020-14422: The `__hash__()` methods of classes `IPv4Interface` and
   `IPv6Interface` had issue of generating constant hash values of 32 and 128
   respectively causing hash collisions, which might allow a remote attacker
   to cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
   performance of a dictionary containing `IPv4Interface` or `IPv6Interface`
   objects. The attacker can moreover cause many dictionary entries to be
   created.
