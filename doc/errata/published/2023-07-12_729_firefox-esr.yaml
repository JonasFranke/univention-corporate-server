desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-37201: Use-after-free condition when creating a WebRTC connection
   over HTTPS.
 * CVE-2023-37202: Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could
   have caused objects from other compartments to be stored in the main
   compartment resulting in a use-after-free.
 * CVE-2023-37207: A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification
   by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a
   mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing
   attacks.
 * CVE-2023-37208: When opening Diagcab files, Firefox did not warn the user
   that these files may contain malicious code.
 * CVE-2023-37211: Memory safety bugs. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
   memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
   could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
