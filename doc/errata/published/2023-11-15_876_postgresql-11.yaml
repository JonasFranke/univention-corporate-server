desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fix handling of unknown-type arguments in `DISTINCT` "any" aggregate
   functions. This error led to a text-type value being interpreted as an
   unknown-type value (that is, a zero-terminated string) at runtime. This
   could result in disclosure of server memory following the text value.
   (CVE-2023-5868)
 * Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions: When
   assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the current
   array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in edge cases.
   Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution
   are possible, and so is disclosure of server memory. (CVE-2023-5869)
 * Prevent the `pg_signal_backend` role from signalling background workers and
   autovacuum processes: The documentation says that `pg_signal_backend`
   cannot issue signals to superuser-owned processes. It was able to signal
   these background processes, though, because they advertise a role OID of
   zero. Treat that as indicating superuser ownership. The security
   implications of cancelling one of these process types are fairly small so
   far as the core code goes (we'll just start another one), but extensions
   might add background workers that are more vulnerable. Also ensure that the
   parameter `is_superuser` is set correctly in such processes. No specific
   security consequences are known for that oversight, but it might be
   significant for some extensions. (CVE-2023-5870)
