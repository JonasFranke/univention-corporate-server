 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * For new installations of the package, the RADIUS server can now assign VLAN
   IDs to user connections if their group has set the attribute "vlanId". The
   UCR variable "freeradius/vlan-id" has been added to set a VLAN ID even if
   the user is no member of any such group.
