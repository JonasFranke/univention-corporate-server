 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The package has been migrated to Python 3. The UMC module will still be
   executed via Python 2 until UCS 5.0-2 due to possible custom plugins for
   sending the password recovery tokens. Customers need to provide their
   custom plugins for Python 3 until then.
