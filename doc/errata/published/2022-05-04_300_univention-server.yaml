 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The `server_password_change` mechanism has been adjusted to first validate
   that the new machine password successfully replicated in OpenLDAP before
   finally changing the password locally in Samba/AD. Quickly reverting
   password changes in AD easily breaks DRS replication, so prevent this
   situation from happening.
