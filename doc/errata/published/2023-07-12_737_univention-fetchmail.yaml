src: univention-fetchmail
fix: 13.0.6-5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The values of univentionFetchmailSingle and univentionFetchmailMulti
   can't be correctly parsed when the values contain characters like ';'.
   The property is now stored as json to simplify the parsing of the complex
   attribute and avoid errors when non-alphanumeric characters appear.
   The fix is applied after force-reexecuting the joinscript
   92univention-fetchmail-schema.inst. If fetchmail is installed on a
   non-primary server, the primary and non-primary servers need to be updated
   to the same errata level before force-reexecuting the joinscript to
   minimize possible unknown side effects.
 * The Fetchmail UDM hooks did not work in combination with the UCS@school
   importer. They are now compatible after force reexecuting the joinscript
   92univention-fetchmail-schema.inst.
