src: univention-s4-connector
fix: 14.0.15-2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * To allow for a faster initial synchronization the connector
   now prioritizes objects of type `container/ou`.
 * By default resync_object_from_ucs.py now uses the local LDAP
   server for LDAP lookups. Use the option `--from-primary`
   for the old behavior (LDAP lookup on primary directory node).
