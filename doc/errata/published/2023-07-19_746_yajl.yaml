 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-33460: memory leak when using the `yajl_tree_parse` function
   which causes out-of-memory and crashes of the server.
 * CVE-2017-16516: In `yajl-ruby gem 1.3.0` for Ruby, when a crafted JSON
   file is supplied to `Yajl::Parser.new.parse`, the whole ruby process
   crashes with a `SIGABRT` in the `yajl_string_decode` function in
   `yajl_encode.c`. This results in the whole ruby process terminating and
   potentially a denial of service.
