 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When joining a system to a UCS domain with a large number of objects
   in the LDAP directory, the script `create_spn_account.sh` restarted the
   S4-Connector too often while waiting for the service principal name to
   appear in the Samba/AD SAM directory, possibly causing additional delay.
   This has been fixed.
