desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-41859: the EAP-PWD function `compute_password_element()` leaks
   information about the password which allows an attacker to substantially
   reduce the size of an offline dictionary attack.
 * CVE-2022-41860: when an EAP-SIM supplicant sends an unknown SIM option, the
   server will try to look that option up in the internal dictionaries. This
   lookup will fail, but the SIM code will not check for that failure.
   Instead, it will dereference a NULL pointer, and cause the server to crash.
 * CVE-2022-41861: A malicious RADIUS client or home server can send a
   malformed attribute which can cause the server to crash.
