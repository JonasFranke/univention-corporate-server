fix: 16.0.7-24A~5.0.0.202209071531
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The objectclass `univentionObject` now offers two additional optional
   attributes `univentionObjectIdentifier` and `univentionSourceIAM`.
   `univentionObjectIdentifier` will be used by some apps to track the
   object identity regardless of the source of the object (e.g. either
   `entryUUID` or `objectGUID`) and in a way that is independent of
   implementation of the IAM backend (e.g. OpenLDAP or Active Directory).
 * An additional ACL access directive for the machine account provides
   faster access to DNS zone objects.
