 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Joining a backup node into a single server UCS@school environment failed
   because the ldb module `univention_samaccountname_ldap_check` attempted to
   create an object of type `computers/windows` for it which always failed
   because the account name was already taken by the
   `computers/domaincontroller_backup` object.
