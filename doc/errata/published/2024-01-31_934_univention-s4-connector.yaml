 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Initial join could take a long time in cases where customers
   have a lot of DNS records in Samba/AD. The join script now
   prioritizes objects (DNS zones etc) that are essential for
   operation of Samba/AD. This improves usability during initial
   joins and rejoins.
