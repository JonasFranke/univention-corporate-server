fix: 2:4.18.3-1A~5.0.0.202307171116
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously
   crafted request can trigger an out-of-bounds read in winbind
   and possibly crash it (CVE-2022-2127).
 * SMB2 packet signing was not enforced if an admin configured
   "server signing = required" or for SMB2 connections to
   Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory (CVE-2023-3347).
 * An infinite loop bug in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight
   can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker by issuing a
   malformed RPC request (CVE-2023-34966).
 * Missing type validation in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight
   can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a process crash
   in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process (CVE-2023-34967).
 * As part of the Spotlight protocol Samba discloses the server-side
   absolute path of shares and files and directories in search results
   (CVE-2023-34968).
 * After Microsoft released the July 2023 updates, Windows clients showed
   login errors. Samba has been adjusted to handle the new behavior of
   netlogon secure channel negotiation.
